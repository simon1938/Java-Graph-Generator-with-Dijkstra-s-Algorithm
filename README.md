# Java Graph Generator with Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Description
Java Graph Generator is a project aimed at creating an interactive application for generating graphs and calculating the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. This project is implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly tool for visualizing graphs and finding the shortest path between nodes.

## Features
- Graph creation and visualization with interactive interface.
- Dijkstra's algorithm implementation for finding the shortest path.
- Ability to add, delete, and modify nodes and edges.
- Visual representation of the shortest path between two nodes.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls.
